### Question

A 24 year old man is hit by a baton just above the knee on his right leg. This is followed by loss of motor control of the leg. His foot drops and is unable to dorsiflex his foot. There is loss of sensation over the front and outer half of the leg and dorsum of the foot. What is the SINGLE most likely anatomical structure to be affected?

#### Option 1

A. Sural nerve

#### Option 2

B. Common peroneal nerve

#### Option 3

C. Tibial nerve

#### Option 4

D. Lateral plantar nerve

#### Option 5

E. Medial plantar nerve

#### Answer

B. Common peroneal nerve


#### Notes

This is actually called a peroneal strike. A peroneal strike is a temporarily disabling blow to the common peroneal nerve of the leg, just above the knee which causes a temporary loss of motor control of the leg, accompanied by numbness and a painful tingling sensation from the point of impact all the way down the leg, usually lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes in duration.
